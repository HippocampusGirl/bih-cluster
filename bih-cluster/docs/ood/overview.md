# OOD Portal

This part of the documentation describes the Open OnDemand (OOD) Portal of the BIH HPC, or just: "The Portal".
OOD is a software that provides secure, easy-to-use, browser-based, and graphical access to the BIH HPC resources.
Most importantly, this allows you to run graphical programs on the HPC such as Juptyer (fka iPython Notebooks), RStudio Server, but also MATLAB.

- For the impatient: start here at [https://portal.research.hpc.bihealth.org](https://portal.research.hpc.bihealth.org).

## What can the portal do for you?

- Lower the barrier of entry into using the HPC by providing a graphical interface.
- Easily run web server based apps such as Jupyter and RStudio without the hassle of SSH tunnels.
- Run Linux desktop applications such as MATLAB and MaxQuant.

We plan to integrate more features into the portal such as user-level cluster monitoring (including Ganglia) and storage quota reporting.
