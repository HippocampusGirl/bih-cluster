# Storage Volumes

!!! info "No mounting **on** the cluster itself."
    For various technical and security-related reasons, it is not possible to mount anything on the cluster nodes by users.
    That is, it is not possible to get file server mounts on the cluster nodes.
    For mounting the cluster storage on your computer, see [Connecting: SSHFS Mounts](/connecting/sshfs-mounts/).
